### Background

Mentor Me is a platform for learners and mentors to connect with each other. This full-scale web app was largely inspired by our team's experience at MakerSquare and all the wonderful benefits of the effective mentorship we found during out time there. With Mentor Me, people are able to find and connect with willing and able teachers. Or, on the flip side, people itching to give back can sign up for a mentoring account.
